# Final Project

### intro 
part of a course on computer comunications, we were instructed to write a custom sniffer code in python that would sniff from our network a whatsapp group that we're part of. <br/>
note this is ethical as we're part of the whatsapp group and just need to store the inter-message delays and the message sizes, we're not interfering or trying to attack the IM application.<br/>

### the paper 
we based our project on the paper "Practical Traffic Analysis Attacks on Secure Messaging Applications." The paper posits that despite the claims of IM applications to ensure complete secrecy, it is possible to gather valuable insights about the transported data using straightforward statistical methods and filtering techniques.
For every distinct group outlined in the paper, we generated visual representations of the inter-message delays and message sizes. Our goal was to identify distinct patterns unique to each group, including messages, images, videos, files, and audio groups.

we will discuss the following points:
1. Are there unique characteristics for each group?
2. Can one deduce the groups you take part in using the techniques detailed in the paper?<br/>
and explored two scenarios:
1. When the targeted user is exclusively active in, at most, a single instant messaging (IM) group.
2. When the targeted user might be concurrently active in multiple IM groups.
