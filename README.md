# Final Project

### intro 
part of a course on computer comunications, we were instructed to write a custom sniffer code in python that would sniff from our network a whatsapp group that we're part of. <br/>
note this is ethical as we're part of the whatsapp group and just need to store the inter-message delays and the message sizes, we're not interfering or trying to attack the IM application.<br/>
